## Setting Up a Full Backup (System Image Backup)

### Step 1: Select Backup Option
1. In the main interface, click on **Backup** on the left sidebar.
2. Choose **System Backup** to create a full system image of your current setup. This includes your operating system, installed applications, and system settings.

### Step 2: Choose Destination
1. You’ll be prompted to select a destination for your backup. You can choose an external hard drive, network drive, or another partition.
2. Ensure that the destination has enough space to hold your backup (usually at least 50% of your disk space is needed).

### Step 3: Start Backup
1. After selecting the destination, click **Start Backup**.
2. AOMEI Backupper will create an image of your system drive. This may take some time, depending on the size of the data and your hardware.

### Step 4: Backup Completed
1. Once the backup is complete, you’ll see a confirmation screen with the option to create a **bootable rescue disk**. This disk can help you restore your system in case of a disaster.
2. Keep the backup image safe on your chosen destination.

## Creating a Backup Schedule (Optional)

2. Under the **Backup** tab, select **Schedule Backup** and the bottom of the window.
3. Click the slide-button on the right, and set your preferred backup frequency (e.g., daily, weekly).
4. Click the **Backup Scheme** menu option on the left, and choose the type of backup: full, incremental, or differential. **Incremental** will only back up changes since the last backup, saving space and time.

## Backup Tips

- **Keep Multiple Copies**: It’s always a good idea to have multiple backup copies on different drives (e.g., internal and external).
- **Test Your Backups**: Occasionally, test your backup by performing a trial restore to ensure it’s working correctly.
- **Use Incremental Backups**: After the initial full backup, use incremental backups to save space and reduce backup times.
